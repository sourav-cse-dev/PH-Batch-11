    In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor <small>contractor</small> at CERN, <em>proposed</em> and
    <i>prototyped</i> ENQUIRE, a system for CERN <em>researchers</em> to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee
    wrote a memo proposing an <em>Internet-based</em> hypertext
    system.[4]

    Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN
    data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally
    adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is
    used"; an encyclopedia is the first <b>entry</b>.[5]
