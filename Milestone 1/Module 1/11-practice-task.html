        When I first travelled within Romania, it opened my eyes to how other
        people live. I saw how people lived happily even though they did not
        have much money or luxuries. It taught me that to be happy, money is not
        the only thing. I must have an attitude to be happy with what I have. It
        also taught me to accept people from different races and colors. When I
        travelled abroad, I saw new cultures and different lifestyles.
